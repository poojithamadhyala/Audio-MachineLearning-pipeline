# 🎧 Low-Latency Audio Machine Learning Pipeline

A production-style **audio event classification pipeline** designed for **real-time, low-latency inference**, inspired by on-device audio use cases such as **headphones and smart audio systems**.

This project covers the **entire applied ML lifecycle** — from dataset ingestion and model training to ONNX export, latency benchmarking, and API-based inference.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🎵 **Audio Event Classification** using MFCC features + lightweight CNN  
- ⚡ **Ultra-low latency inference**: **0.039 ms (batch=1)** via ONNX Runtime  
- 📊 **~94% test accuracy** on Speech Commands v0.02 dataset  
- 🍎 **Apple MPS backend** used for local training on macOS  
- 🔁 End-to-end pipeline: training → evaluation → export → deployment

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Real-time audio systems (e.g., headphones, wearables, embedded devices) require:
- Extremely **low inference latency**
- Small, efficient models
- Reliable performance under tight compute constraints

This project demonstrates how to design an **ML pipeline optimized for such constraints** while maintaining strong accuracy.
